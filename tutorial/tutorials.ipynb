    "\n",
    "Libigl is an open source C++ library for geometry processing research and development. The python bindings combine the rapid prototyping familiar to Matlab to Python programmers with the performance and versatility of C++. The tutorial is a self-contained, hands-on introduction to libigl in Python.  Via interactive, step-by-step examples, we demonstrate how to accomplish common geometry processing tasks such as computation of differential quantities and operators, real-time deformation, parametrization, numerical optimization and remeshing. Each section of the lecture notes contains a simple Python example application.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Chapter 1\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce libigl with a series of self-contained examples. The purpose of\n",
    "each example is to showcase a feature of libigl while applying to a practical\n",
    "problem in geometry processing. In this chapter, we will present the basic\n",
    "concepts of libigl.\n",
    "\n",
    "### libigl design principles\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting into the examples, we summarize the two main design principles in\n",
    "libigl:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No complex data types.** We mostly use `numpy` or `scipy` matrices and vectors. This greatly\n",
    "  favors code reusability and interoperability and forces the function authors to expose all the\n",
    "  parameters used by the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function encapsulation.** Every function is contained in unique Python function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Downloading libigl\n",
    "libigl can be downloaded from our [Conda forge](todo!). All of libigl functionality depends only on `numpy` and `scipy`. For the visualization in this tutorial we use a custom viewer based on `pythreejs`. Other Python plotting libraries such as `plotly` or `matplotlib` can be used as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To start using libigl you just need to import it together with the `numpy` and `scipy`"

    "### Mesh representation\n",
    "\n",
    "libigl uses `numpy` to encode vector and matrices and `scipy` for sparse matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "A triangular mesh is encoded as a pair of matrices:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "V: numpy.array\n",
    "F: numpy.array\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`V` is a #N by 3 matrix which stores the coordinates of the vertices. Each\n",
    "row stores the coordinate of a vertex, with its x,y and z coordinates in the first,\n",
    "second and third column, respectively. The matrix `F` stores the triangle\n",
    "connectivity: each line of `F` denotes a triangle whose 3 vertices are\n",
    "represented as indices pointing to rows of `V`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A simple mesh made of 2 triangles and 4 vertices.](images/VF.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the order of the vertex indices in `F` determines the orientation of\n",
    "the triangles and it should thus be consistent for the entire surface.\n",
    "This simple representation has many advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. it is memory efficient and cache friendly\n",
    "2. the use of indices instead of pointers greatly simplifies debugging\n",
    "3. the data can be trivially copied and serialized\n",
    "\n",
    "libigl provides input [output] functions to read [write] many common mesh formats.\n",

    "```\n",
