    "Libigl is an open source C++ library for geometry processing research and development. The python bindings combine the rapid prototyping familiar to Matlab to Python programmers with the performance and versatility of C++. The tutorial is a self-contained, hands-on introduction to libigl in Python.  Via interactive, step-by-step examples, we demonstrate how to accomplish common geometry processing tasks such as computation of differential quantities and operators, real-time deformation, parametrization, numerical optimization and remeshing. Each section of the lecture notes contains a simple Python example application."

    "\n",
    "We introduce libigl with a series of self-contained examples. The purpose of\n",
    "each example is to showcase a feature of libigl while applying to a practical\n",

    "\n",
    "Before getting into the examples, we summarize the two main design principles in\n",
    "libigl:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No complex data types.** We mostly use `numpy` or `scipy` matrices and vectors. This greatly\n",
    "  favors code reusability and interoperability and forces the function authors to expose all the\n",
    "  parameters used by the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function encapsulation.** Every function is contained in a unique Python function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Downloading Libigl\n",
    "Libigl can be downloaded from [Conda forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/igl):\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge igl \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All of libigl functionality depends only on `numpy` and `scipy`. For the visualization in this tutorial we use [meshplot](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/meshplot) which can be easily installed from Conda:\n",

    "conda install -c conda-forge meshplot \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
